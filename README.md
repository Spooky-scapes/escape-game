### Features

Besides voice narration and visual animations, the main feature of our application is the voice command functionality. The game can be played entirely using the spacebar and commands such as "click on" or "go to". The tutorial screen goes over all the commands in the game. This functionality was enabled by Javascript's built in Web Speech API.

### Credits

The Spooky Scapes team is comprised of Jason Yang, Savion Sweeney, Lily McGowan, and Andrea Childress. We could not have done this without the amazing help of our Fullstack Academy fellow Hernan Berisso as well as our instructors Ben Rodriguez and Jibron Harris. Thanks to everyone who made this possible!
