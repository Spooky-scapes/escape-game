# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In addition to the normal CRA modules/imports, Sass has been added.

Note that .css files have been changed to .sass files, and the imports for .css files have been changed as well

### Welcome to Spooky Scapes!

This is a point and click escape game created with accessibility in mind for those who are visually or hearing impaired. Our team wanted to make a fun and enjoyable but also inclusive experience.

### Installation

Make sure to 'npm install' before attempting to run the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Features

Besides voice narration and visual animations, the main feature of our application is the voice command functionality. The game can be played entirely using the spacebar and commands such as "click on" or "go to". The tutorial screen goes over all the commands in the game. This functionality was enabled by Javascript's built in Web Speech API.

### Credits

The Spooky Scapes team is comprised of Jason Yang, Savion Sweeney, Lily McGowan, and Andrea Childress. We could not have done this without the amazing help of our Fullstack Academy fellow Hernan Berisso as well as our instructors Ben Rodriguez and Jibron Harris. Thanks to everyone who made this possible!
